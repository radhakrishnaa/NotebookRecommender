# NotebookRecommender
jupyter notebook recommender with whoosh
This script is designed to process a folder of jupyter notebooks and retireves a list of relevant notebooks as per a user's search string.

Currently, the path to folder is hardcoded but it is very easy to change the code to accept the folder path as an input.

Comments were added inside the code to make it more readable.
